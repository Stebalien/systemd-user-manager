Links the systemd user manager with the system manager.

Currently, it does the following:

1. Inhibits system shutdown till the user manager terminates. This gives
services that depend on system services a chance to shutdown.

2. Pulls in the user manager's sleep target before sleeping (inhibiting sleep
until it loads).
